# LossRatios
DTSA 5509 Introduction to Machine Learning Supervised Learning - Final Project

# Agency Performance ML Project

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict and analyze agency loss ratios using a cleaned dataset from Kaggle.

## 🔍 Objective
- Predict agency performance (loss ratio) using features like state, production line, and agency ID.
- Identify top/bottom performing agencies and states.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Full EDA, preprocessing, and model pipelines (Random Forest, etc.).
- `dataset/`: Source dataset used for training and testing.
- `images/`: Visualizations generated during analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries used (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn).

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## See Final Project.ipynb for full project code
